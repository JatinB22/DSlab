        "A **Decision Tree** is a versatile, non-parametric supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both **classification** and **regression** tasks. It's one of the most intuitive and interpretable models in machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "A decision tree works by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. You can think of it as a flowchart or a game of \"20 Questions,\" where each question about a feature helps to narrow down the possible outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Structure of a Decision Tree\n",
        "* **Root Node:** The top-most node which represents the entire dataset. It gets split into two or more homogeneous sets.\n",
        "* **Internal Node (or Decision Node):** Represents a test on a feature. It splits into child nodes based on the outcome of the test.\n",
        "* **Leaf Node (or Terminal Node):** Represents the final decision or outcome. For classification, it's the class label; for regression, it's a continuous value. These nodes do not split any further.\n",

        "## 2. How a Decision Tree is Built\n",
        "\n",
        "Decision trees are built using a **top-down, greedy approach** known as recursive partitioning. The process starts at the root node with the entire dataset and recursively splits the data into smaller subsets.\n",
        "\n",
        "The core idea is to find the **best feature** to split the data at each step. \"Best\" means that the resulting child nodes are as **\"pure\"** as possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "* In a **classification** task, a pure node is one where most or all of the samples belong to a single class.\n",
        "* In a **regression** task, a pure node is one where the samples have very similar target values (low variance).\n",
        "\n",
        "This process is **greedy** because the algorithm makes the optimal choice at the current step without considering future steps. It continues splitting until a stopping criterion is met.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The General Algorithm (CART)\n",
        "The most common algorithm for building decision trees is the **CART (Classification and Regression Tree)** algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Start with the entire dataset at the root node.\n",
        "2.  For every feature, find the best split that maximizes the purity of the resulting child nodes. The \"best split\" is determined by a **cost function** (like Gini Impurity or Entropy for classification, and MSE for regression).\n",
        "3.  Choose the feature and its corresponding split value that result in the best cost reduction.\n",
        "4.  Split the current node into child nodes using the chosen feature and split value.\n",
        "5.  Repeat steps 2-4 for each child node recursively.\n",
        "6.  Stop splitting when a stopping criterion is met (e.g., the node is pure, the tree has reached its maximum depth, or the number of samples in a node is too small).\n",

        "\n",
        "* **Perfect Purity:** If a node contains samples of only one class ($p_i=1$), the Gini Impurity is $1 - 1^2 = 0$.\n",
        "* **Maximum Impurity:** For a binary classification problem, if a node has a 50/50 split of classes ($p_1=0.5, p_2=0.5$), the Gini Impurity is $1 - (0.5^2 + 0.5^2) = 0.5$.\n",

        "\n",
        "A major challenge with decision trees is their tendency to **overfit**. An overfitted tree is one that is too complex (very deep with many nodes) and has learned the noise in the training data too well. Such a tree performs poorly on new, unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "To combat overfitting, we control the complexity of the tree using a technique called **pruning** or by setting stopping criteria.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Pre-Pruning (Early Stopping):** This involves setting constraints on the tree's growth. We stop building the tree before it becomes overly complex. Common hyperparameters for pre-pruning include:\n",
        "    * `max_depth`: The maximum allowed depth of the tree.\n",
        "    * `min_samples_split`: The minimum number of samples a node must have to be considered for splitting.\n",
        "    * `min_samples_leaf`: The minimum number of samples required to be in a leaf node.\n",
        "    * `max_leaf_nodes`: Limit the total number of leaf nodes.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Post-Pruning (or Pruning):** This technique allows the tree to grow to its full complexity first. Then, it goes back and removes (prunes) branches that do not provide significant predictive power, typically by evaluating them on a validation set.\n"
